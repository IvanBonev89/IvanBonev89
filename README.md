### Hi! I`m @IvanBonev 👋

<!--
**IvanBonev89/IvanBonev89** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I am working on testing TVs and detecting errors in codes. Recording TV logs and registering problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python in SoftUni
- 👯 I’m looking for cooperation for exchange of experience and creation of common projects.
- 💬 I am also involved in graphic design, video and audio editing, music, and marketing.
